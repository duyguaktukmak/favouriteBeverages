      <p>
        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds
        of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are
        picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as
        "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired
        flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water
        to produce the beverage known as coffee.

      <p>
        Hot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate, cocoa, and as chocolate
        tea in Nigeria, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, melted
        chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a
        sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream or
        marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes
        called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker
        consistency.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salep">Salep</a>
      <p>
        Salep, also spelled sahlep or sahlab,is a flour made from the tubers of
        the orchid genus Orchis (including species Orchis mascula and Orchis
        militaris). These tubers contain a nutritious, starchy polysaccharide
        called glucomannan. Salep flour is consumed in beverages and desserts,
        especially in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, notably in the
        Levant where it is a traditional winter beverage. An increase in
        consumption is causing local extinctions of orchids in parts of Turkey
        and Iran.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothie">Smoothie</a>
      <p>
        A smoothie is a thick and creamy beverage made from pureed raw fruit,
        vegetables, and sometimes dairy products (e.g. milk, yogurt, ice-cream
        or cottage cheese), typically using a blender.Smoothies may be made
        using other ingredients, such as water, crushed ice, fruit juice,
        sweeteners (e.g. honey, sugar, stevia, or syrup), whey powder, plant
        milk, nuts, nut butter, seeds, tea, chocolate, herbal supplements, or
        nutritional supplements. A smoothie containing dairy products is similar
        to a milkshake, though the latter typically contains less fruit and
        often uses ice cream or frozen yogurt.
